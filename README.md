# :information_source: About Me
* :computer: I'm a DevOps Engineer and open source developer
* :heart: I really love working on open source projects - there's nothing more satisfying to me than building something well from the ground up and putting it in the hands of real users even if it's only small.
* :floppy_disk: I love figuring out old computers and legacy applications as much as building new ones!
* :rooster: Fun Fact - I have exactly one duck and one chicken, fondly named Duck and Chicken respectively

## :hammer: Tools I Work With
* 📦 Docker and Kubernetes
* :penguin: Linux
* 🌊 AWS 
* :snake: Python
* 🕸️ JavaScript
* 🐪 Perl
* 🐘 PHP
* and many more I couldn't find emojis for

## :open_file_folder: Favorite Projects
1. <a href="https://github.com/Ara225/ara225.DynamoDBUserStore">ara225.DynamoDBUserStore</a> - A C# ASP .NET Core library that allows developers to store users and roles in AWS DynamoDB when using ASP .NET Core Identity. This is my favorite because it's the most likely to be used in production, it has full test coverage, and is quite well written. Byproduct of me trying to learn C#
2. <a href="https://github.com/Ara225/node-js-pxe-server">node-js-pxe-server</a> - A Node.js module written in JavaScript that runs a PXE server - server for network booting computers. I like this project because it sounds like it shouldn't work, but it very much does.
3. <a href="https://github.com/Ara225/regex-copy-or-cut">regex-copy-or-cut</a> - A JavaScript/Node.js VsCode Extension. The first piece of code I ever published, and also the one with the most downloads.
4. <a href="https://github.com/Ara225/serverless-audiobook-maker">serverless-audiobook-maker</a> - A AWS serverless pipeline to create a speech-to-text audiobook from a text file uploaded to a S3 bucket. Turned out to be useless as AWS Polly isn't as good as it's cracked up to be, but it was fun to make.
